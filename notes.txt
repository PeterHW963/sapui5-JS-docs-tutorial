controller, view, and i18n are convention names.

*.view.xml is the convention for view.
*.controller.js is the convention for controllers.
Component.js is the convention for component. Is there only 1 component per app???

capitalisation conventions:
Controller names are capitalized
View names are capitalized
Resource bundle keys are written in (lower) camelCase

manifest.json is the application's descriptor file
